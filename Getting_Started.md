Getting Started
=====================
Before performing tasks on the HPC, it is useful to know how to navigate through a linux command-line. Some basic commands include:

| command | use |
| :----: | :----: |
| ls | list all files |
| ls -lh | list all files with their filesize |
| cd {directory name} | enter {directory name} |
| cd .. | move back one folder from current location |
| pwd | give current filepath |
| head -n# {filename} | list first # lines of {filename} |
| tail -n# {filename} | list last # lines of {filename} |
| vi {filename} | view all of {filename} |
| rm {filename} | permanently delete {filename} |  
| mv {file} {location} | moves {file} to {location} |
| cp {file} {location} | copies {file} to {location} |
