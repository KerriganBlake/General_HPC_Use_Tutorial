#Parallelizing Computation: Rotation Example

In this example, we'll walk through a bit of computation that I had to do as part of my research. Hopefully along the way we'll demonstrate:
* Writing, compiling and running C code
* Using Mathematica to get a handle on unfamiliar math
* A little trick I came up with to get Mathematica to write C code for us
* Using the HPC to get a lot of computation done quickly
